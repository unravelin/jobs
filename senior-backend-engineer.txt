Senior Backend Engineer
Ravelin Technology
London
March 2015

About

    Ravelin are looking for a senior backend engineer to lead the development
    of a high volume fraud technology platform within a small tech team. As a
    founding engineer you will be invited and expected to have opinions about
    the strategic direction of the company and products, as well as leading the
    development team from the front. A successful candidate will be willing to
    learn new skills (machine learning, neural networks, python, golang, cloud
    automation etc), turning their hand to necessary tasks and working with
    complete autonomy.

Technology

    Services are primarily written in Golang with Python used in data science
    heavy areas. Docker is used to standardise deployment and management across
    multiple languages and environments. Automation is paramount and we
    practice a strict continuous deployment policy.  We embrace open source and
    begin with the mindset of writing our software to be public. We encourage
    everyone at Ravelin to share & present our work at conferences and
    collaborate with others wherever possible.

Expertise in

    Code for Humans
        Your machine is happy if it compiles; your team is happy if they can
        understand what it does. Your pull requests are succinct and a pleasure
        to review, you have unit tests where it matters, and you understand
        that the code is not, in fact, the documentation.

    Reliable & Resilient Software
        Not for you the happy path or the assumed network. That habit of yours
        of assuming the worst and planning for it has earned you stripes in the
        world of running software at scale under real world conditions.

    Tools for the Team
        Whether it's a smart command line utility or a core internal library,
        you excel at improving everyone's lives by removing repetition & common
        sources of error, and by solving hard problems in accessible ways. You
        build internal processes that are so reliable they melt into the
        background but are key to getting shit done.

    APIs
        You've been on the receiving end of APIs good and bad, and want to
        delight our customers with the high quality they expect. You know that
        whilst everything should be JSON, sometimes you have to get your hands
        dirty with some SOAP for that critical integration but know how to
        isolate the contagion.

Knowledge of

    Go, AWS, Linux, docker, NoSQL/Cassandra (Mongo & Redis don't count),
    PostgreSQL, Git, Agile development, distributed system design, CI/CD
